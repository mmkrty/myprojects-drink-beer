## Why I built this App?

When I moved to Germany in 2018, I began to see the charm of beer to the locals. I am still amazed by the gentle-looking student who finished three bottles(500ml) of beers silently in front of me during a language exchange. Although I still didn't learn to appreciate the taste of beer in the end, drinking beer is obviously an integral part of life here.

A moderate amount of beer is not only relaxing and enjoyable, it can also be good for your health, but drinking too much is a different story. This app aims to remind people in a light-hearted and humorous way that while they drink, they should not forget that over drinking is bad for their health.

## Functionality

Inspired by a course project I built [Drink water](https://mmkrty.github.io/50-drink-water/) this app tracks users’ drinking amount and gives feedbacks according to their inputs.

Users can manually click the small cups to indicate how much they have already drank. The avatar and message box then gives feedbacks. While at first the feedbacks are encouraging, they become more serious and cautionary when the user’s consumption passed a certain amount. The color and font style would also change to indicate the seriousness of over drinking.

## Improvements to be made

### Visually:

- A more interesting avatar: could make a new avatar which includes the function of the big cup. This way, the beer could directly into the avatars stomach.
- A dynamic facial expression: the facial expression could change according to the amount of beer consumed.
